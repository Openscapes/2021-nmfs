Hello world! :zap:

I am Beth Phillips from the NWFSC, and I'm trying to learn how to use GitHub to share my code and collaborate with the FEAT team!

# The power of open science: publishing with GitHub

We can use GitHub to publish on the open web. GitHub supports Markdown text formatting. For example, with Markdown:

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

## We can make headers.

We can make lists that are automagically numbered – *note that lists need a carriage return before list items!*
Here's what FEAT wants to do:

1. Get a GitHub FEAT Organization set up
1. tamales
1. cakes

[Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) can also make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. For example:

> [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. 
Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

Here's the [FEAT webpage](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/sustainable-fisheries/fisheries-engineering-and-acoustic-technologies-team) for more information about our research:

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. *Note that from the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.* 

## Your turn
