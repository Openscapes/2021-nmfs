# GitHub workflow 101

![](git-intro.png)

## Key Skills

1. Clone a repo to your computer
2. Commit and push changes from your computer back to GitHub
3. Pull changes from GitHub to your computer

[lecture on these key skills](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/week2-moregit.html)

## Set-up

* Option 1. GitHub Desktop. Install (or have IT install), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Option 2. RStudio [read this](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/set-up.html#Git_from_RStudio). PC users, you will need to install Git (or have IT install it). GitHub Desktop will install Git for you but it is in an odd location.
* Option 3. If you have been using Git/GitHub/GitLab for awhile, you might explore GitKracken. More features. I find it overkill personally but others like it a lot. Read the section in RStudio set-up about setting up your PAT [here](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/set-up.html#Git_from_RStudio).

**GitHub Desktop:**

* Pros: Developed by GitHub, nice if you have to manage many repositories, easy to deal with merge conflicts, easier to add titles and descriptions to commits, easier to clone your own repos to your computer, authentication is seamless, itâ€™ll suggest issues if you type #, good if someone is not using RStudio (say using Word, Excel, etc)
* Cons: If you are working in RStudio, you have to go to a different app to commit/push, search feature is not as good as other apps (RStudio)

**RStudio:**

* Pros: If your coding platform is RStudio, then you don't need to go to a different app, has good search feature, easy to get to shell if you need to do something from the command line, easy to clone repo and make an RStudio project at the same time.
* Cons: Set-up is a hassle and maybe not sustainable for team if many on team need help, authentication with GitHub can be hard (but getting easier), can't see status of multiple repos, hard to jump between repos, doesn't suggest issues to link to commit, 2 pop-up windows for a commit, no help fixing merge conflicts and actions it suggests is bad, some/many team members on a project don't need RStudio.

**GitKracken and others:**

There are many other platforms for interacting with GitHub (and GitLab, Bitbucket, etc). GitKracken is a common one. If you are already a VCS (version control system) power-user, you might look into GitKracken if you find GH Desktop and RStudio lacking. I find GitKracken overkill, but others really like it.


## Skills

### Skill 1. Clone a repo to your computer

1. Create the repo in your GitHub account or organization
2. Pull onto your computer

**Let's see it done!** I'll show GitHub Desktop and ask someone else to demo from RStudio.

* In my personal work, I clone with RStudio and mostly pushes/pulls with GitHub Desktop. Why? Faster and GH Desktop allows me to interact faster with my 50+ repos that I manage. Also GitHub Desktop makes it super easy to deal with merge conflicts. Easy peasy. I could waste half a day and trash my repo if I deal with those in RStudio.
* In teaching or helping colleagues, I **only** use GitHub Desktop. Why? The amount of futzing (5 nasty steps) to get RStudio connected is an unsustainable time-suck when I multiply that by the many people I help. GitHub Desktop works immediately. 

**Let's see it done!**

### Skill 2. Commit local changes and push to GitHub

This is 2 steps.

1. "Commit" Add a note about the change and add it to the history of changes.
2. "Push" Push those changes (and notes) up to GitHub. **pro-tip** you can link to a particular issue with `#` in your note.

**Let's see it done!**

### Skill 3. Pulling changes from GitHub

Pretty much just a button click, unless there are merge conflicts.

**Let's see it done!**

# GitHub Project Boards and Organizations

During week 1, many of you expressed the desire to learn how to do project boards in GitHub to help with your project planning. Here is how I do it.

## Organizations

I set up organizations for each of my projects. A cross-organization project board is not possible (as far as I know) so I track on my personal GitHub `Readme.md` file. It's all automatic. Look at the [Readme.md](https://github.com/eeholmes/eeholmes/blob/main/README.md) file.

## Project Boards

1. Skill 1 Setting up a project board and adding columns
2. Skill 2 Manually add and moving cards

That's all you need. For those who like automation.

3. Skill 3 Creating an automated board with tracking
4. Skill 4 Customizing automation with **project-bot**

### Examples

* Basic project board 1: [To Do and Done](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS/projects/1)
* Org project board: [repo status](https://github.com/orgs/nwfsc-timeseries/projects/1)
* Basic project board 2: [Months/Milestones](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS/projects/8)

### Automation (or semi-automation)

This is for those who use **issues**. This IMO works best if you are using labels and milestones on your issues.

* GitHub's basic Kanban automation
* [**project-bot**](https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot) [Let's see it in action](https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/MARSS/projects/8) 
* Setting up **project-bot**. You do this at the personal or organization level not repo level and you need admin rights at that level. [Go here to install](https://github.com/apps/project-bot)
