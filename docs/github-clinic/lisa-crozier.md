# The power of open science: publishing with GitHub

We can use GitHub to publish on the open web. GitHub supports Markdown text formatting. For example, with Markdown:

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

## We can make headers.

### Can we connect to google sites using github?

Find our [Climate Team page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-nwfsc-climate-network/home)

Does our repo (lisa439/Climate-Team) have to be public, or can we have restricted repos also display a webpage?
How do we delete a file on our computer, and not have it prevent github from syncing everything else?

We can make lists that are automagically numbered – *note that lists need a carriage return before list items!*

1. bananas
1. tamales
1. cakes

[Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) can also make hyperlinks using the `[]()` pattern: you put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. For example:

> [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1287772985630191617) describes the palmerpenguins R package. 
Learn more on the [palmerpenguins webpage](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins).

We can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. *Note that from the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.*
