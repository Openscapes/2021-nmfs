Learn more about Openscapes and the Champions Program: https://openscapes.org.\n\nCohort Agendas\nWe will meet as a Cohort via Zoom four times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Fridays in September and October 2021. Additionally, we will schedule several GitHub Clinics before Call 2.\nDates: September 17, October 1, 15 & 29\nTimes: 11-12:30pm PST\nLocation: Remotely, via Zoom\nAgenda links below are only accessible to Cohort participants (coming soon!), as they are also an archive of our live google-docing. Please see https://openscapes.org/series for more detail and to view blank versions of the agendas.\nDate\nCohort Call Agendas\nSeries Chapters\nBetween Cohort Calls\n09/17\n1.

Tip: You can listen instead of read material online via talkify.\nParticipating teams\nThese are the teams participating: please edit this repo yourself following our GitHub Clinic!\nThe NWFSC Eco/Stock Assessment Team is a cross-divisional team (Fisheries Resource and Monitoring, Conservation Biology and Fish Ecology) at NWFSC. The team’s will be working on analyses and visualization of fisheries-dependent and -independent data to inform both groundfish stock assessments and integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA). Potential projects include 1) analysis of ecosytem drivers and associated responses, 2) estimation of species-specific habitats in the context of fishing gear utilization, 3) incorporation of ecosystem considerations into stock assessments, 4) visualization of IEA indicator distributions and trends, and/or 5) development of a strata explorer app. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe NWFSC FEAT Team is from the Fisheries Resource and Monitoring division at NWFSC. This team will focus on streamlining data tracking/sharing/processing within the Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies (FEAT) team, as well as improving onboarding/offboarding of personnel, coordinating Pacific hake biomass calculation dataflow for stock assessors, MSE, and other interested parties. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe NWFSC Protected Salmonids Team is from the Conservation Biology division at NWFSC. This team will be working on improving data workflow related to protected PNW salmonids. We will be focusing on more robust data workflows: 1) better data tracking, 2) personnel on-boarding systems, 3) loss of critical connections with our diverse data partners when staff retire or leave, and 4) implementing more automated data workflows. Team members are from the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program working on the PNW Viability Reports that support the WCR Status Reviews for endangered and threatened salmonids and from the Genetics and Evolution Program working on the salmon bycatch RM&E program in the west coast groundfish fisheries. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe NWFSC WRAP Team is a cross-divisional team from the Fish Ecology and Fisheries Resource and Monitoring divisions at NWFSC. This team is working to coordinate sharing of data for marine ecosystem or life cycle modeling projects. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe AFSC Team is from the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) division at AFSC. This team will be working improve data, code and report workflows for survey data. Data: curation, processing and dissemination, including implementing continuous integration. Code: improving collaboration on code packages survey data processing and prep, streamlining code development and sharing. Reports: automating reports, collaborating on proposal writing, and automating standard data products. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe SEFSC Team is part of the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR; http://sedarweb.org/) in the Sustainable Fisheries division at SEFSC. This team will be working on improving data workflow, automating reports, and collaborating on packages and functions for assessment model output and diagnostics for Southeast stock assessments for the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Atlantic. Web presence/GitHub Org:\nThe NEFSC Team To come\nOpenscapes team\nJulie Lowndes, Openscapes founder and co-director, NCEAS, UCSB, lead\nEli Holmes, NWFSC Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program, co-lead\nCorey Clatterbuck, Seagrant Fellow at the California Water Boards Office of Information Management and Analysis, assisting\nMore Background on Openscapes and the Champions program:\nOur path to better science in less time using open data science tools (Lowndes et al 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution) - this paper greatly influences the whole Champions program and we’ll ask that everyone participating reads it before our first Cohort Call on September 9.\nOpenscapes: Better Science for Future Us - 2021 plenary talk at the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE) inaugural conference\nOpenscapes embraces kindness and inclusion in open science - 2021 article about Openscapes\nopenscapes.org – Openscapes is operated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis, UC Santa Barbara\nThis opportunity is funded in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).\n\n\n\n\n",
